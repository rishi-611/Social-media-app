## A Social Media App to connect developers

**Checkout the Website**: [Website Link]([title](https://www.example.com))



TechConnect is a MERN stack social media platform, which uses jsonwebtokens for authentication and bcrypt for password hashing

Here you can signup, create your profile, add public posts that every member can see, like and comment.
You can view all profiles, their github repos, if provided by the user and so on.
You can edit your profile anytime, and if you delete your account, your profile and all posts also get deleted.

The authentication is done through JWT tokens, and all active tokens are stored in user data, so you can login and logout from multipe accounts independently
Passwords are hashed via bcrypt, which keeps userdata safe

The css theme is not completely my original work. I used the css theme from Brad Traversy's DevConnect github project. Although a lot of changes to the initial design were made, aimed towards website responsiveness, and better user experience
